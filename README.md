This study investigates the factors associated with the Arousal Index (AI) in patients potentially affected by Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA). The Arousal Index is a key measure indicating how often a person’s sleep is disrupted due to breathing irregularities.

Using data collected from 122 individuals, the analysis explores the relationship between AI and several explanatory variables, including Body Mass Index (BMI), Neck Size, Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), and Age.

A multiple linear regression model was fitted to examine how well these variables explain the variation in AI. Initial model validation and residual diagnostics indicated a generally appropriate model, with some multicollinearity concerns—particularly between BMI and Neck Size. Subsequent model selection favored a reduced model excluding BMI, slightly improving adjusted R2R2 while maintaining a strong fit.

The study provides insights into how physiological and demographic factors correlate with sleep disturbances, helping guide further research and clinical screening in the context of OSA.
